A collection of various shell scripts I have written over the years.

## License

All scripts are licensed under the MIT License. For more, see the LICENSE file.

## Usage

To add the "bin" directories to your path, source `sh-snippets/bin-paths.sh`
from your bashrc.

The other "snippets" in `sh-snippets` may also be handy to source from your
bashrc if you find them useful.
